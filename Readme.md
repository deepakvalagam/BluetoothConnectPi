# BluetoothConnectPi

Do you travel a lot with your Pi?
Are you scrambling for a display, keyboard and mouse when giving that customer demo?

Worry no more, now you can connect your Pi to any Wifi connection without a display or peripherals! All you need is a smartphone!

BluetoothConnectPi is a solution that helps you travel easier with your Raspberry Pi. It is a simple set of scripts that when added to your Pi, can help you use your smartphone to add Wifi Networks to your Pi and get SSID and IP details from it (so that you can use the Pi on SSH or Virtual Desktop mode)

What is more? The code is all available open-source on GitHub and you can clone it to add it to your project the way you want. You can give the end-user app a boost by adding a page to manage Wifi connections of your product.
